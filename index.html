        <div class="question">What is cloud computing?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including
          servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and
          intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”). Cloud providers offer
          different levels of service, from infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
          to platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). This
          allows businesses and individuals to access powerful computing
          resources without having to invest in expensive hardware or maintain
          their own infrastructure.

        <div class="question">What is a VPN?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool that allows you to create
          a secure and encrypted connection between your device and the
          internet. This connection is established through a remote server,
          which allows you to access the internet as if you were in a different
          location. VPNs are commonly used to protect your online privacy and
          security by hiding your IP address and encrypting your internet
          traffic.

        <div class="question">What is machine learning?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows
          computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being
          explicitly programmed. This is achieved through the use of algorithms
          and statistical models that analyze data and identify patterns.
          Machine learning is used in a variety of applications, including image
          recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
